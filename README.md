- **Console-Based UI:** The user interface is built to run in the console, making it easy to interact with the system.

## User Actions

1. Insert a new vehicle into the garage.
2. Display a list of license plates in the garage.
3. Change a vehicle's status.
4. Inflate a vehicle's wheels to the maximum.
5. Refuel a fuel-powered vehicle.
6. Charge an electric vehicle.
7. Display the full details of a vehicle.
8. Exit the garage.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Core**

## Focus on OOP and Error Handling
The **Garage Manager** system leverages:

- **Polymorphism** to handle different vehicle types with a single interface.
- **Inheritance** to allow code reuse across different vehicle classes.
- **Encapsulation** to maintain clean and maintainable code architecture.
- **Custom Exception Handling** to validate input, ensuring safe interactions and detailed error messages.
